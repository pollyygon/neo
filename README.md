### AI Disclosure

**1. AI usage:**

    AI was minimally used. I used Gemini to find the name of a font that I liked and to generate some asteroid images that were ultimately not used.

**2. Manual Work:**

    I approached all the coding manually. I did it manually because AI assistance hampers learning. This was my first time using React Native and I wanted to learn more about it on my own.

**3. Evaluating AI Suggestions:**

    NA
  
**4. Modifications:**

    NA

**5. AI in my workflow:**

    When I use AI at work, I mostly use it for large errors that I haven't been able to figure out. I also use AI when I don't understand a concept. For example. "Explain XYZ like I'm 5 years old" or "Create a real world analogy for XYZ"
